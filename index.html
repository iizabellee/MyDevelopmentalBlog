        <h1>Week 2 Blog</h1>
        <p>I learnt about semantic web and the different elements used.For example, header, nav, article and section. 
            These make your code easier to understand and allows it to be more organised.</p>
        <p>I also learnt that the div element itself has no inherent meaning. 
            It is simply a container, and there's often a more specific semantic choices.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>Additionally, I learnt about CSS and how to link the CSS file to the HTML file so that 
            it defines the style of the HTML file.</p>
        <p>A CSS rule I learnt is that we use curly braces so that all styles inside these will apply to the HTML elements
            that belong to the selector.</p>
        <p>I also learnt about the 3 methods for CSS. The first one being the inline style, the second one being the style element
            and the third one being the link element/external style sheet. </p>
        <p>The hash symbol (#) tells the CSS code that this is an ID and the period (.) 
            tells the CSS code that that is a class name.</p>
        <p>I learnt that A set of "pseudo classes" can style anchor elements
            depending on their state.</p>
        <p>I also learnt how to change the typography which is the font and the colours.</p>

        <h1>Week 3 Blog</h1>
        <p>I learnt how to use the form tag, input tag, label tag and writing simple validations. </p>
        <p>The form tag is used to collect information that is provided. </p>
        <p>The input tag allows user to input certain data. This is the most important element of a form as it allows you to obtain
            the necessary information.</p>
        <p>I also learnt that we can apply flexbox styling to any HTML element, which means you can restyle and reflow independently
            of each other.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learnt how to use CSS and the link of the CSS file to the HTML file so that the CSS can work in the HTML file.</p>
        <p>The z-index property lets you control the depth of elements on the page. The z-index property is directly related to
            stacking order and it's what prevents elements from overlapping other elements.</p>
        <p>I also learnt how to use Adobe XD to do wireframes to make websites.</p>

        <h1>Week 4 Blog</h1>
        <p>I learnt how to use responsive images for flexible layouts and better understand Flex Layouts. </p>
        <p>With responsive images in viewing websites in desktop and mobile views, it will auto resize based on screen size,
            have better performance such as loading higher resolution images only when needed and 
            providing better design control depending on device ID.</p>
        <p>I also did some practices to achieve a max-width where the property sets a maximum width for an element, which
            does not allow the width of that element to be larger than its max-width value.</p>
        <brk></brk>
        <p>I also learnt that if I want to achieve an image that sticks to its original size, I have to ensure that the 
            max-width is 100% and the width should be 400px.</p>
        <p>I also learnt about using images as cover to fit the images into a box.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, I learnt how to do the text overlay in the additional challenge by using the div tag
            and styling it in the CSS file.</p>
